# Flashcard Web App  
Submitted by: **Sai Rithwik Kukunuri**

For this **Flashcard Web App** project, I have created an interactive system where users can study, learn, or play a guessing game using flashcards. The app displays flashcards in a random order and allows users to flip cards to view either the question or the answer. Users can click through the cards, making learning fun and engaging.

Time spent: **[2]** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following functionality **goals** have been completed:

- [x] Initialize a new React application.
- [x] Create functional React components for the flashcard system.
- [x] Define and store card pairs (question/answer) in an array.
- [x] Implement functionality to flip cards between their question and answer.
- [x] Add a "Next" button to display a new random card.
- [x] Display the title, description, and total number of cards in the set.
- [x] Style the cards and components using CSS.

The following **required features** are implemented:

- [x] Display one card at a time, showing either the question or answer.
- [x] Clicking on the card reveals the answer.
- [x] Clicking the "Next" button shows a random new card.
- [x] Display the card set's title, description, and total number of cards.

## Notes

The Flashcard Web App allows users to study using flashcards that display a question or an answer. Key challenges in this project included managing the card flipping logic, randomizing the order of the cards, and ensuring smooth transitions between the cards. The app now offers an engaging and interactive study tool for users to explore.
