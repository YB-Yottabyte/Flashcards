For this **Community Board**, I have created an resources of user manual for various programming langauges. The board should have a unique purpose, such as links to help users learn more about software engineering. On each card of your community board, I have displayed some information about the resource.

## Notes

The community board includes a user manual for all programming languages, built with React and JavaScript. Challenges included correctly defining props, avoiding duplicate elements, formatting numbers, and sorting events with precise logic. These issues were solved with testing and small adjustments.
